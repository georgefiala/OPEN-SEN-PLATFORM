Open SEN (special education needs) is a collection of apps for SEN which were developed continuously. These apps are also in close connection with previously proposed i-CT Framework â€“ app for central management in special education. All of these apps can thus use common SEN services directly from i-CT Framework without any need of handling these services on its side. 

i-CT Framework tool works as central management app including users (class) manager, SEN apps manager (following the pre-defined communication protocol) and security (rights) manager. Thus each developer of new SEN app can just focus at the proper educational tasks in his app without the need of handling of app data management stuff around. Such developed app then works as the add-on of this framework tool.

In present time OPEN SEN PLATFORM includes following apps  at all (beside the i-CT Framework app):
